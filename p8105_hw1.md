# Description of Penguins Data and Mean

``` r
data("penguins",package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

In the dataset `penguins` there are *344 rows* and *8 columns*. Each row
represents a penguin’s species type, island location, bill length (mm),
bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex (m/f) and year.
For this dataset the mean flipper length is *200.9151 mm*.

# Create a Scatterplot

``` r
myplot2 = 
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,col = species)) + geom_point() 

myplot2
```

# Problem 2

# Creating a New Dataframe

``` r
third_df = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(10),
  logical = norm > 0, 
  vec_char = c("one","two","three","two","one","one","two","one","two","three"),
  vec_fac = factor (c("one","two","three","one","two","three","one","one","two","three"),
                    levels = c("one", "two", "three" ))
  
)
```

# Taking Means of Each Variable

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.304169

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(third_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(third_df,vec_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(third_df, vec_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Simply pulling the column from the dataset and getting the mean was
succesful for the *normally distributed variable* and *logical
variable*. The reason it worked for the normally distributed variable is
straight forward because it has numeric values. However, for the logical
variable, it was still able to calculate a mean because it labeled the
character variables as either a ‘0’ or ‘1’, so this value allows us to
interpret it as a proportion (had the true value).

Unlike *vector variable* or a *factor variable* which R does not give
values of ‘O’ or ‘1’ so when trying to calculate the mean of a character
value, it will only say “NA”.

# Converting variables

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(third_df,logical)))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

Get the same mean for logic, makes sense!

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(third_df,vec_char)))
```

    ## Warning in mean(as.numeric(pull(third_df, vec_char))): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(third_df,vec_fac)))
```

    ## [1] 1.9

*How do I not show the output. Is it already doing that?*

When we convert these variables into numeric values. The R code is able
to do it succesfully for only *logic variable* and the *vector
variable*. The same method is used to explain what’s happening to the
logic variable *above*. However, it can not do it for a character
variable because it doesn’t know the diffence between the groups, unlike
the vector which tells it how to rank it.

R doesn’t want to do this because it doesn’t know how to acutely
discribe the length difference between these three levels.

Still won’t do the character. Succesfully does logic and vec_fac.
